# Gas Chromatography with Arduino Uno

This project demonstrates the use of an **Arduino Uno** to collect data from a **Gas Chromatography (GC)** system. By integrating the Arduino with **PLX-DAQ** (Parallax Data Acquisition tool), we can collect real-time data and analyze it on a computer using Excel.
